# Create two vectors A and B of 36 elements each
A = [1, 2, 3, ..., 36]
B = [1, 2, 3, ..., 36]

# Sum the elements of vector A with the corresponding elements of vector B and store the result in a vector C
C = [A[i] + B[i] for i in range(len(A))]

# Print the resulting vector C
print("The resulting vector is:", C)
